# Euclidean minumum spanning tree

The project contains the implementation of the algorithm for constructing the Euclidean minimum spanning tree in optimal time 
![O(Nlogâ‚‚N)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O%28N%5Clog_2%20N%29) by sequentially applying the Delaunay triangulation 
algorithm and the Kruskal's algorithm on the graph. The project also provides implementations of these algorithms.
